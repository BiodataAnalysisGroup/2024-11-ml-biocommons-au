## Introduction to Machine Learning in R - from data to knowledge

With the rise in high-throughput sequencing technologies, the volume of omics data has grown exponentially. A major issue is to mine useful knowledge from these heterogeneous collections of data. The analysis of complex high-volume data is not trivial and classical tools cannot be used to explore their full potential. Machine Learning (ML), a discipline in which computers perform automated learning without being programmed explicitly and assist humans to make sense of large and complex data sets, can thus be very useful in mining large omics datasets to uncover new insights that can advance the field of bioinformatics.

This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to the ML taxonomy and the applications of common ML algorithms to health data. The workshop will cover the foundational concepts and common methods being used to analyse omics data sets by providing a practical context through the use of basic but widely used R libraries. Participants will acquire an understanding of the standard ML processes, as well as the practical skills in applying them on familiar problems and publicly available real-world data sets.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of the workshop you should be able to:

- Understand key ML concepts, common algorithms and terminology
- Understand the importance of ML in analysing complex, high-volume health-related data
- Use R packages to implement an ML workflow on real-world dataset, from data preparation to model application and evaluation

### Lead Trainer

Dr **Fotis Psomopoulos**, *Senior Researcher* 

Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB)<br>
Center for Research and Technology, Hellas (CERTH)



### Workshop Format

The workshop will be run as a series of code-along sessions, with some additional activities for participants to complete throughout the sessions. All participants will stay in the main room, unless they are experiencing technical difficulties and require 1:1 support from a trainer. 

**Date/Time**: Monday 9 December 2024, 
*1 - 5 pm AEDT / 12 - 4 pm AEST / 12:30 - 4:30 pm ACDT / 10 am - 2 pm AWST*

**Location**: Online

### Who the workshop is for

This workshop is for Australian researchers who are or will apply ML to the analysis of omics data as part of their projects. It is suitable for beginners in ML. You must be associated with an Australian organisation for your application to be considered.

### Prerequisites

No previous knowledge of ML is required or expected (please note, that this will be an introductory course to ML)
Familiarity with the R programming language. If you need a refresher on R/RStudio try the Introduction to R and RStudio section of this online tutorial

### How to apply

This workshop is free but participation is subject to application with selection. 

**Applications close at 11:59pm AEST, 24 November 2024.**

Applications are reviewed by the organising committee and all applicants will be informed of the status of their application (successful, waiting list, unsuccessful). Successful applicants will be provided with a Zoom meeting link closer to the date. More information on the selection process is provided in our Advice on applying for Australian BioCommons workshops.
